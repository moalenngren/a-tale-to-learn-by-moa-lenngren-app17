But then, all of a sudden, a big buffalo cow comes running to save Kenneth! He stumbles on the way to Kenneth, embarrassing... With her long tail she whips off the big and ugly villain, hits the villain with her armoured hoof and embraces Kenneth with her long and fluffy fur. He was saved.
His friend though, Bertli Boo, died from the tail whip.
