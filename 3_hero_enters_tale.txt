But then, all of a sudden, a big buffalo cow comes running to save Kenneth! 
He stumbles on the way to Kenneth, embarrassing... 
With her long tail she whips off the big and ugly villain, hits the villain with her 
armoured hoof and embraces Kenneth with her long and fluffy fur. He was saved without a scratch.
His friend though, Bertli Boo, sadly passed away from the tail whip.
